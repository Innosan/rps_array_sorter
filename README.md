# RPS Array sorter function
## This function sorts an array of numbers in both orders.

In this function, we will sort an array of numbers in both ascending and descending orders. We will use the bubble sort algorithm to sort the array. The bubble sort algorithm compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is sorted.

## Structure
`soring_algorithms` - Folder containing the sorting algorithms

`utility` - Folder containing the utility functions like generating random numbers

`index.ts` - Main file to run the function

`types` - Folder containing the types like `SortOrder` etc.

Each crucial function has its own test file next to it.
To run the tests, run `npm test` in the terminal.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm i`
